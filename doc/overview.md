[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/express42-cookbooks/ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/express42-cookbooks/ruby)

Cookbook `ruby` builds various versions of ruby and installs them to `/opt/rubies`. It uses [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) to build and install ruby and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) for switching between installed ruby versions.
